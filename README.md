Customer Support & Product Review Analysis System
Overview
This comprehensive data analysis system processes and analyzes customer support interactions and product reviews to extract actionable business insights. The pipeline handles data cleaning, transformation, and visualization for three key data types: product information, customer reviews, and support email threads.

Data Processing Components
1. Product Data Cleaning (clean_products_file())
Standardizes product records from JSON files

Handles column renaming and consolidation:

Unifies product ID fields

Normalizes price columns (USD, retail, MSRP)

Flattens nested details structures

Outputs cleaned data with consistent schema:

product_id, name, category, price, features

2. Review Data Processing (clean_reviews_file())
Processes CSV review data with:

Date standardization

Rating normalization (1-5 scale)

Text cleaning (lowercase, whitespace)

Duplicate removal

Outputs structured review records:

review_id, product_id, rating, review_text, review_date

3. Email Thread Analysis (main() pipeline)
Processes multiple JSON email files

Extracts key thread metrics:

Resolution timeline (start/end dates)

Message volume and exchange rate

Participant analysis (company vs manufacturer)

Evidence detection (attachments/keywords)

Outputs enriched thread data with:

Temporal metrics, communication patterns, content features

Analytical Capabilities
Temporal Analysis
