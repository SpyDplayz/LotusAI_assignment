# Data Cleaning and Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive data cleaning and analysis pipeline for processing product information, customer reviews, and email marketing data. The pipeline standardizes, transforms, and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the datasets, providing valuable insights through visualization.

## Features
- Standardizes and cleans product, review, and email datasets.
- Handles missing values, duplicates, and incorrect formatting.
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations.
- Provides insights into customer behavior and product performance.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the script:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LotusAI_assignment.git
cd LotusAI_assignment
```


## Data Processing Workflow
1. **Loading Data**
   - Reads product, review, and email datasets into Pandas DataFrames.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handles missing values.
   - Removes duplicate entries.
   - Corrects inconsistent formatting.

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Standardizes categorical values.
   - Extracts relevant features.
   
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Generates summary statistics.
   - Creates visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Visualization Examples
- Distribution of product ratings
- Monthly email engagement trends
- Correlation analysis between product categories and reviews
